# üìâ Monte Carlo Simulation for Stock & Crypto Portfolio Risk Analysis

## Overview

This project explores how a mixed portfolio of **stocks** and **cryptocurrencies** might behave over the long term using a **Monte Carlo simulation** approach. I ran this simulation to understand the **risk** I‚Äôd be taking on before investing my own money.

Rather than looking at just average returns or volatility, this model simulates 100 different 1,000-day futures to help answer questions like:

- How bad could it get?
- How good can it get?
- What are the odds of losing money?

If you're curious about financial risk modeling or how compounding works under uncertainty, you're in the right place.

## Purpose

I created this tool while evaluating a portfolio I was seriously considering. I didn‚Äôt just want to know historical averages. I wanted to **see the range of possible outcomes** based on actual past behavior; especially given how unpredictable crypto markets can be.

This project gave me a clearer sense of:

- Potential losses during extended downtrends
- How much return volatility affects long-term outcomes
- What kind of growth paths are most common vs. rare

---

## Methodology

Here's what the simulation does under the hood:

- Uses daily **log returns** from adjusted close prices for each asset
- Allocates capital with a fixed weighting: **85% stocks / 15% crypto**
- Caps daily return outliers at ¬±5% to avoid skew from black swan events
- Runs **100 simulation paths**, each over **1,000 days**, using bootstrapped historical returns
- Compounds returns over time using `cumprod(1 + x)` and visualizes with `ggplot2`

## Outputs

- üìà **Simulated Growth Chart**: [MC_STK-Port.png](MC_STK-Port.png)  
  A visual of all 100 simulated portfolio paths across 1,000 days

- üìä **Final Return Summary**  
  Min: ‚àí77.08%  
  Max: +637.08%  
  Median: ~380%  

- ‚ùó **Probability of Loss**: 49%  
  Nearly half of the paths resulted in a net loss, even with strong average returns. Risk is real.

---

## Key Takeaways

- Most return paths landed well above the starting point, but the **tail risk** on both ends is significant.
- The **median return was very strong**, but nearly **half the simulations ended below zero**, showing how compounding and volatility interact.
- Crypto assets introduce major upside potential, but they also drive a lot of the downside risk.
